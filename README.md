# Overview

This app helps users to figure the tip amount out.

The app take the input from the user, and performs the calculations based on the percentage chosed by the user, and returns the corresponding tip. It also provides a way to round the tip up.

The porpouse of this app was to excercise my understanding of Android Studio.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Android Studio. Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Android applications.

For the code, I used Kotlin. It manages all the calculations. It is an object-oriented language that is used for general application development including Android mobile app development. It is based on the Java language. Kotlin was designed to provide improvements to the Java language while still supporting the Java libraries. Library support includes data structures, file operations, and networking.

And for the elements that are in the screen, XML was used.
